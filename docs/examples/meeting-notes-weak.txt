Project Status Meeting - December 15

Attendees: Marketing, Engineering, Design

Discussion Points:

1. Q1 Launch Timeline
   - I think we should maybe push the launch to February
   - I feel like the current timeline is kind of aggressive
   - I'm not sure, but I think we need 2 more sprints

2. Budget Concerns
   - I was wondering if we could revisit the marketing budget
   - Sorry to bring this up, but I disagree with the allocation
   - I'll try to prepare a revised proposal by next week

3. Design Review
   - The mockups are just a rough draft at this point
   - I only have a few suggestions, if that's okay
   - Does that make sense to everyone?

Action Items:
- Alex: I'll try to finish the competitor analysis
- Jordan: Hopefully can get the prototype ready
- Sam: Maybe schedule follow-up with stakeholders

Next meeting: TBD (sorry, I forgot to book the room)
