Subject: Proposal for Website Redesign Project Dear Mr. Thompson, I wanted to reach out regarding your website redesign project. I believe our agency would be a good fit for this work, and I was wondering if you'd be interested in discussing it further. Based on our initial conversation, I believe we could maybe help you achieve your goals. I'm not sure of the exact timeline, but I believe we could probably complete the project in 8-10 weeks. I'm sorry if this proposal is a bit rough - I wanted to get something to you quickly. Here are some thoughts: Proposed Approach:
- I believe we should start with a discovery phase
- We could do some user research?
- I believe the current site navigation is kind of confusing Budget Estimate:
I hate to discuss money, but I believe the project would cost somewhere between $15,000-$20,000. I could be wrong though - it really depends on scope. Let me know if you have questions for your budget? I will put together a more detailed proposal by next week. We will schedule a call to discuss. Sorry to take up your time with all this! Looking forward to hearing from you, if you're interested. Best regards,
