Subject: Quick follow-up on yesterday's meeting

Hi Sarah,

I wanted to follow up on our conversation from yesterday. We should maybe consider pushing back the launch date by a week or two. I believe the team might need more time to finish the testing phase.

Excuse me with this, but I was wondering if you could check with the dev team about their timeline? I know you're busy, so I hate to ask, but it would really help.

Also, I disagree with the decision to cut the onboarding flow. I believe it might cause confusion for new users. Let me know if you have questions? I could be wrong though.

I will get the updated mockups to you by Friday. We will review them together next week, if you have time.

Thanks for your patience with all my questions!

Best,
Alex
