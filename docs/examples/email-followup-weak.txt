Subject: Quick follow-up on yesterday's meeting

Hi Sarah,

I just wanted to follow up on our conversation from yesterday. I think we should maybe consider pushing back the launch date by a week or two. I'm not sure, but I feel like the team might need more time to finish the testing phase.

Sorry to bother you with this, but I was wondering if you could check with the dev team about their timeline? I know you're busy, so I hate to ask, but it would really help.

Also, I'm sorry, but I disagree with the decision to cut the onboarding flow. I feel like it might cause confusion for new users. Does that make sense? I could be wrong though.

I'll try to get the updated mockups to you by Friday. Hopefully we can review them together next week, if you have time.

Thanks for your patience with all my questions!

Best,
Alex
