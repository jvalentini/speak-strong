Self-Assessment: Q4 Performance Review

Accomplishments:
I think I did a pretty good job on the customer portal redesign. I feel like the user feedback has been kind of positive, though I'm not sure of the exact numbers.

I just wanted to mention that I also helped onboard two new team members. It was maybe a bit challenging, but I tried my best.

Areas for Improvement:
I'm sorry, but I know I need to work on my presentation skills. I feel like I get kind of nervous in large meetings. I'll try to practice more next quarter.

I was wondering if it would be possible to get some training on the new analytics platform? I hate to ask, but I think it would really help me.

Goals for Next Quarter:
- Hopefully finish the mobile app integration
- I'll try to improve my documentation
- Maybe take on a mentorship role if anyone needs help

Additional Comments:
I just wanted to say thanks for all the support this year. Sorry if I was sometimes slow to respond to messages. Does this assessment make sense?
