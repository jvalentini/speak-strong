Subject: Proposal for Website Redesign Project

Dear Mr. Thompson,

I just wanted to reach out regarding your website redesign project. I think our agency would be a good fit for this work, and I was wondering if you'd be interested in discussing it further.

Based on our initial conversation, I feel like we could maybe help you achieve your goals. I'm not sure of the exact timeline, but I think we could probably complete the project in 8-10 weeks.

I'm sorry if this proposal is a bit rough - I just wanted to get something to you quickly. Here are some thoughts:

Proposed Approach:
- I think we should start with a discovery phase
- Maybe we could do some user research?
- I feel like the current site navigation is kind of confusing

Budget Estimate:
I hate to discuss money, but I think the project would cost somewhere between $15,000-$20,000. I could be wrong though - it really depends on scope. Does that make sense for your budget?

I'll try to put together a more detailed proposal by next week. Hopefully we can schedule a call to discuss. Sorry to take up your time with all this!

Looking forward to hearing from you, if you're interested.

Best regards,
Jamie Chen
Account Manager
