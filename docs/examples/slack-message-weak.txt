Hey team! Just a quick heads up - I'm not sure, but I think there might be an issue with the payment processing module. I just wanted to flag it before it becomes a bigger problem.

I could be wrong, but I feel like the error rate has been kind of high lately. Maybe we should look into it? Sorry if this is a false alarm!

If anyone has time, I was wondering if you could take a look? I'll try to gather more data in the meantime. Hopefully we can figure it out soon.

Thanks, and sorry to bother everyone with this!
